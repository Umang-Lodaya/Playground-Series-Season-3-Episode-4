## Tabular Classification with a Credit Card Fraud Dataset

## Kaggle Competition Description:
The goals of the Playground Series remain the sameâ€”to give the Kaggle community a variety of fairly light-weight challenges that can be used to learn and sharpen skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science. We hope we continue to meet this objective!

To start the year with some fun, January will be the month of Tabular Tuesday. We're launching four week-long tabular competitions, with each starting Tuesday 00:00 UTC. These will be fairly light-weight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data, and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc.


## Synthetically-Generated Datasets
Using synthetic data for Playground competitions allows us to strike a balance between having real-world data (with named features) and ensuring test labels are not publicly available. This allows us to host competitions with more interesting datasets than in the past. While there are still challenges with synthetic data generation, the state-of-the-art is much better now than when we started the Tabular Playground Series two years ago, and that goal is to produce datasets that have far fewer artifacts.

## Metric
Submissions are evaluated on area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.
